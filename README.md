This is the required repository for Chapter 3, *Mastering Github* of the **Command Line for Web Developers** course.

It was not created using the `git clone` approach. Rather the repo was created on [Github](https://github.com) without a README.md file. A local repository was initialised on my computer and the Github repo added as a remote.

It was an enlightening experince because I learnt intensely how one cannot push to a remote unless they have first created a local commit at least once. This initial local commit gives the remote something to point to locally. 

Now you know what to do when you see the `error: src refspec master does not match any.` error.
